# 360-Degree Feedback Application

A comprehensive enterprise-grade feedback management system built with Streamlit and Turso database.

## Overview

This application facilitates a performance review process where employees receive feedback from multiple sources - peers, subordinates, and supervisors - providing a "360-degree" view of their performance.

## Features

- **Role Assignment** - manage hr roles
- **Question Management** - customize feedback questions
- **System Configuration** - manage settings and preferences

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Turso database account

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Database Setup
The application connects to your Turso database using credentials in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
DB_URL = "libsql://your-database-url.turso.io"
AUTH_TOKEN = "your-turso-auth-token"

# Optional: Email configuration
[email]
smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
smtp_port = 587
email_user = "your-email@company.com"
email_password = "your-app-password"
from_email = "hr@company.com"  # optional; defaults to email_user
```

### 3. Initialize Database
```bash
# Create database schema
python setup/create_schema.py

# Insert initial data (roles, questions, users)
python setup/simple_insert.py
```

### 4. Run Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

 

## Role Structure

The system uses a simplified 2-role structure:

### HR Personnel (hr role)
- **Diana Gomes** (diana@projecttech4dev.org) - Full HR dashboard and administrative access
- **Additional HR Staff** - Can be assigned hr role for management capabilities
- **Access**: Organized into clear sections: Cycle Management, Activity Tracking, Feedback Management, Communication, Employee Management
- **Capabilities**: User management, cycle creation, system settings, analytics, all in professionally organized interface

### Employees (default role)
- **All other users** including Erica Arya, Donald Lobo, Vinod, and all staff members
- **Standard Features**: Request feedback, complete reviews, view results
- **Manager Functions**: Team leads and managers get additional "Approve Team Nominations" access based on designation
- **Automatic**: No special role assignment needed - default for all users

## Deadline Management System

### Streamlined Timeline
The feedback cycle now operates on a simplified 2-phase timeline:

1. **Nomination Phase**: Employees submit feedback requests and managers approve/reject them
2. **Feedback Phase**: Approved reviewers complete their feedback forms

**Removed phases**: Approval deadline and results deadline have been eliminated for simplicity.

### Deadline Enforcement
- **Nomination Deadline**: Once passed, employees cannot submit new requests
  - All pending manager approvals are automatically approved
  - All pending reviewer acceptances are automatically accepted
- **Feedback Deadline**: Once passed, reviewers cannot complete feedback forms
  - Results become available immediately after all feedback is collected

### Per-User Extensions
HR can extend deadlines for individual users when needed:
- **Individual Extensions**: Extend nomination or feedback deadlines for specific users
- **Reason Tracking**: All extensions require documentation
- **Override Capability**: Users with extensions can continue working past general deadlines

### Auto-Acceptance Logic
When the nomination deadline passes:
- Pending manager approvals → Automatically approved
- Pending reviewer responses → Automatically accepted as "yes"
- System logs all auto-accepted items for transparency

## First-Time Login

1. **Set Password**: New users should use "Set Password" to create their account
2. **Login**: Use email and password to access the system
3. **Navigation**: Role-based menu appears based on user permissions

## Nomination System Design

### Core Principles

**Flexible Nomination Process**: Unlike traditional systems that require all nominations at once, this application supports incremental nominations:

- **No Minimum Requirement**: Users can start with 1 reviewer if they choose
- **Maximum of 4**: Hard limit to prevent reviewer overload
- **Incremental Addition**: Add reviewers one at a time or in small groups
- **Status Visibility**: Clear tracking of each nomination's approval and completion status
- **Manager Approval**: Each nomination requires manager approval regardless of when submitted

### Automatic Relationship Mapping

The system automatically determines relationships based on organizational data:

**Mapping Rules**:
- **Same team + no reporting relationship** → **Peer**
- **Different teams** → **Internal Collaborator** 
- **Person reports to you** → **Direct Reportee**
- **Your direct manager** → **Blocked** (cannot nominate)

**No Manual Selection**: Users simply choose reviewers; the system handles relationship classification automatically.

### Nomination Workflow

1. **Employee selects reviewers** from available colleagues (1-4 total)
2. **System automatically maps relationships** based on organizational structure
3. **System validates** reviewer availability and prevents invalid selections
4. **Manager reviews and approves/rejects** each nomination
5. **Approved reviewers receive notification** to complete feedback
6. **Employee tracks progress** in real-time dashboard
7. **Results compiled** once feedback collection phase ends

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Reduces Pressure**: Employees don't need to identify all reviewers immediately
- **Improves Quality**: Thoughtful selection over time vs rushed decisions
- **Flexibility**: Adapt based on availability and workload changes
- **Better Tracking**: Clear visibility into each nomination's status
- **Manager Oversight**: Approval required for each nomination maintains quality control

- **[Rejected]** Manager rejected with reason provided (doesn't count toward 4-person limit)

**Completion Status**:
- **[Pending]** Waiting for reviewer to start
- **[In Progress]** Reviewer has started but not completed
- **[Completed]** Feedback submitted and final

**Relationship Types** (Automatically Assigned):
- **[Peer]** Same team, no reporting relationship
- **[Internal]** Cross-team collaborator, different teams
- **[Reportee]** Direct reports, people who report to you
- **[External]** External stakeholder outside organization
- **[Manager]** Direct manager, cannot be nominated (blocked)
- **[Nominated]** Already nominated, cannot nominate again (greyed out)

### Dashboard Features

## Question Sets by Relationship Type

### Peers/Internal Stakeholders/Managers
- Collaboration, Communication, Reliability, Ownership ratings
- Open feedback on strengths and improvement areas

### Direct Reportees (Leadership Evaluation)
- Approachability, Openness to feedback, Clarity, Communication ratings
- Leadership effectiveness feedback

### External Stakeholders

External stakeholders can be nominated by employees (subject to manager approval), receive a secure email token, and provide feedback without needing to “accept” the request in-app.

- Manager Approval: External nominations go through the normal manager approval workflow.
- Invitations: After approval, the system emails a secure token to the external stakeholder.
- External Login: They authenticate via email + token on the External Stakeholder Login page.
- Minimal UI: They only see the feedback deadline and a “Provide Feedback” action; they do not see any “Request Feedback” features.
- No Acceptance Step: Their request is considered accepted upon token login so they can go straight to the form.
- Anonymity: Their identity is not shown to the requester or the requester’s manager in results.

### Eligibility Rules — New
- Date of Joining (DOJ) policy drives who can request or give feedback:
  - Joined on/before 2025-09-30: Eligible to request feedback and be invited to give feedback
  - Joined after 2025-09-30: Can be invited to give feedback once tenure >= 3 months; cannot request feedback
  - Missing DOJ: Not blocked by default (configurable policy)
- Reviewer selection lists only include users eligible to give feedback per the above rules.
- The “Request Feedback” page is only available to users eligible to request per the above rules.
- Professionalism, Reliability, Responsiveness, Understanding ratings
- Quality of delivery and collaboration examples

## Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: Secure bcrypt encryption

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with role-based navigation
- **Database**: Turso (SQLite-compatible) with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: bcrypt password hashing + session management
- **Email**: SMTP integration for notifications
- **Export**: Excel generation with openpyxl

## Developer Guide

- App entry: `main.py` defines role-based navigation and sidebar menu.
- Authentication: `login.py` sets `st.session_state['authenticated']`, `user_data`, and roles (via `services/auth_service.py`).
- Database: Turso (SQLite) via `libsql_experimental`. All DB helpers live in `services/db_helper.py`.
- Key data model tables:
  - `users`: includes `date_of_joining` (DATE), `vertical`, `designation`, `reporting_manager_email`.
  - `review_cycles`: active cycle with `nomination_deadline`, `feedback_deadline`.
  - `feedback_requests`: one per nomination; tracks `approval_status`, `reviewer_status`, `status` and external fields.
  - `feedback_responses`: final submitted answers.
  - `draft_responses`: in-progress saves.
  - `external_stakeholder_tokens`: token + status for external reviewers.
  - `email_logs`: minimal history of notifications.
- Eligibility logic:
  - Requesters: `services/db_helper.can_user_request_feedback(user_id)` controls visibility/access to the Request page.
  - Reviewers: `services/db_helper.get_users_for_selection` filters eligible reviewers based on DOJ and tenure.
- External stakeholders:
  - Token is generated and emailed only after manager approval.
  - Token login auto-accepts and routes to feedback form.
- Manager tools:
  - Approve team nominations.
  - View reportees’ anonymized feedback (`app_pages/reportees_feedback.py`).
- HR tools:
  - `app_pages/completed_feedback.py` provides named views of completed feedback.
  - Notifications center + reminders under Communication.

Known considerations
- Align `email_logs` schema with runtime fields (this repo’s `setup/create_schema.py` is already aligned).
- Missing DOJ is treated as “not blocked” for now; set it in DB to enforce strict eligibility.
- Excel export requires `openpyxl` (included in requirements).
